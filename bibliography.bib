   abstract = {The applications of nanomaterials have been a multidisciplinary active research area in recent years because of their unique structure, surface chemistry, chemical and physical properties. Moreover, further research on the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of nanomaterials is as vital as synthesis. Thermal analysis (TA) methods are used in a wide range of areas, including quantitative and qualitative analysis, the characterization of mechanical, chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials, and to obtain further insight into their structure. This review illustrates the applications of TA techniques in nanomaterials research in the past decade (2010–2020). The highlighted studies bring valuable insight into the evidence of the ability of TA techniques to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the nanomaterials.},

   abstract = {Pharmaceutical cocrystals, owing to their manifold applications, are acting as bridge between drug discovery and pharmaceutical product development. The ability to scale up pharmaceutical cocrystals through continuous manufacturing approaches offers superior and economic pharmaceutical products. Moreover, cocrystals can be an aid for the nanoparticulate systems to solve the issues related to scale-up and cost. Cocrystals grabbed attention of academic researchers and pharmaceutical scientist due to their potential to target various diseases like cancer. The present review is mainly focussed on the diverse and comprehensive applications of pharmaceutical cocrystals in drug delivery including solubility and dissolution enhancement, improvement of bioavailability of drug, mechanical and flow properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients, controlled/sustained release and colour tuning of API. Besides, phytochemical based cocrystals, multi-drug cocrystals and cocrystals for tumour therapy have been discussed in this review. Additionally, recent progress pertinent to pharmaceutical cocrystals is also included, which may provide future directions to manufacturing and scale-up of cocrystals.},

   abstract = {Pharmaceutical cocrystals, an important multi-component complex compressing at least two molecules linked by noncovalent bonds within the same crystal lattice, have shown a great promise in development of new drugs by improving their physicochemical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as solubility, dissolution rate, stability, permeability, tabletability and bioavailability. Consequently, they have substantially benefited the pharmaceutical industry, since many APIs in preclinical stage exhibit poor solubility or permeability, with 90% of all new drugs classified as Biopharmaceutics Classification System II/IV classes. At present, various instrumental-based methods, such as X-ray diffraction, thermal methods, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, have been developed to identify and characterize pharmaceutical cocrystals. Among them, the thermal method is a fast, economical and solvent-free technique for cocrystals’ study. In the present work, the authors review various thermal analyses used in the characterization of pharmaceutical cocrystals including differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, temperature-modulated differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic vapor sorption, hot-stage microscopy, thermal micro-Raman spectroscopy, hot-melt extrusion and thermal hyphenated technologies. The advantages of thermal analysis used in solid-state pharmaceuticals were highlighted. The future trend of thermal analysis application in pharmaceutical cocrystals was summarized.

   abstract = {This review discusses a set of instrumental and computational methods that are used to characterize hydrated forms of APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients). The focus has been put on highlighting advantages as well as on presenting some limitations of the selected analytical approaches. This has been performed in order to facilitate the choice of an appropriate method depending on the type of the structural feature that is to be analyzed, that is, degree of hydration, crystal structure and dynamics, and (de)hydration kinetics. The presented techniques include X-ray diffraction (single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)), spectroscopic (solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (ssNMR), Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy), thermal (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)), gravimetric (dynamic vapour sorption (DVS)), and computational (molecular mechanics (MM), Quantum Mechanics (QM), molecular dynamics (MD)) methods. Further, the successful applications of the presented methods in the studies of hydrated APIs as well as studies on the excipients’ influence on these processes have been described in many examples.},

   abstract = {The successful development of polymeric drug delivery and biomedical devices requires a comprehensive understanding of the viscoleastic properties of polymers as these have been shown to directly affect clinical efficacy. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) is an accessible and versatile analytical technique in which an oscillating stress or strain is applied to a sample as a function of oscillatory frequency and temperature. Through cyclic application of a non-destructive stress or strain, a comprehensive understanding of the viscoelastic properties of polymers may be obtained. In this review, we provide a concise overview of the theory of DMTA and the basic instrumental/operating principles. Moreover, the application of DMTA for the characterization of solid pharmaceutical and biomedical systems has been discussed in detail. In particular we have described the potential of DMTA to measure and understand relaxation transitions and miscibility in binary and higher-order systems and describe the more recent applications of the technique for this purpose. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},
