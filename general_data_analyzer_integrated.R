    # Row 2 from table t in each document is concatenated into one single vector tempDfDocTemp.

    # All heating cycles are grouped into allcycles

    # calculated, first by outputting them into dataFrameCycle and then combining those into CombinedStats
    # Data is retrieved from CombinedStats per heating cycle in dataframes called dataFrameCycleTemp which are 
    # immediately written to an excel and formatted before the loop restarts.
    # The reason for this many intermediate steps is to be able to potentially expand the project in the future: it might 
    # be useful to have these extra dataframes on hand.
